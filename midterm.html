    There is already a debate brewing about how the church should be restored. Whether the efforts will include building materials similar to destroyed in the fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion once officials fully assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts.

    Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames. The cathedral’s large stained-glass windows appear to be undamaged, and there’s a strong case for restoring the famed structure as closely as possible to its former glory.

    Even the White House offered assistance in the rehabilitation of the cathedral. While Notre Dame is revered around the world, Moeller stressed the importance of considering how other catastrophic fires of major landmarks are handled.

    In St. Landry Parish, La., three black churches burned down from arson within 10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe for the churches had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a Twitter campaign urged people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst the devastation of Notre Dame, the total skyrocketed to $1 million by Wednesday.

    “Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said of Notre Dame. “But we want to make sure that people remember that there are other buildings that are important to other communities. It may not be as famous, but when tragedy strikes there it can be devastating to a particular community or a particular group of people, and sometimes it doesn't get the attention it deserves.”
